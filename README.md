Scripts I wrote to automate stuff on GNU/Linux devices, uploaded to this repo because uploading to GitHub Gists is annoying and nobody would ever be able to find stuff uploaded there.
Not intended to be universal -- these will not work on any of the BSDs, macOS, or Android (unless inside a GNU/Linux chroot).
